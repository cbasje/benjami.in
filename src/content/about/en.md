description: "Hoi, I am Sebastiaan. I am a designer but also developer and I want to create spaces where people can be themselves and thrive. I am interested in the way technology affects its users and often that can be very distant and static. As an observant, playful and honest designer, I want to be the bridge between these too often very different worlds."
