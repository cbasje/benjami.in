description: "A design for a campaign around Climate Injustice"
excerpt: "This is an artwork for We Are Tearfund’s Emerging Influencer course! To show the impact we as western countries have on the world, I decided to turn things around and show how for example a beautiful Scottish loch would look if it was polluted by rubbish from other countries. I call it ‘Climate Injustice Reversed’."

I also designed a social media post to accompany the artwork to show some interesting facts about how much plastic the UK has exported to other countries. It was for example very surprising to me, as someone from The Netherlands, that the UK has shipped a lot of plastic to The Netherlands to then illegally be shipped to countries in the Far East, exploiting looser controls over shipments to Europe.
